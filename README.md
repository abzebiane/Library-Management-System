Implemented a singleton Library class for centralized data management, along with Book and Member classes using builder and interface patterns for code flexibility. Integrated a Fa√ßade library to simplify borrowing and returning processes. Prioritized clean code practices and scalable architecture, with future enhancements planned to include advanced search and diverse media support.
